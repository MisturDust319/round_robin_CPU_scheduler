## Results
For each process:
- Start Time
    clock time when the process enters the ready queue
- End Time
    clock time when the process finishes execution
- Interarrival Time
    current process start time - prev proc start time
- Initial Wait
    time in wait queue before first execution cycle
- Total Wait
    total wait time
- Turnaround Time
    time in running state

For test:
- Average turnaround time
- Average service time
    time to finish processes/num processes
